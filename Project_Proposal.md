## Abstract
The goal of our research is to better understand the causes of the huge inequality gap between healthcare in different countries. We think this question is important because health is a basic and essential need for all human beings, but the health services provided by many countries in the world are insufficient. We think if we need to solve the problem, we need to first understand the reason that led to this situation. In this case, we find an essential factor and use data to illustrate how the factors are influential to cause the inequality.

## Introduction
“Health for all now!” is the slogan of the People’s Health Movement. However, we are still far from accomplishing it. Along with the outbreak of the pandemic, more and more studies began to focus on longstanding gaps in medical care, especially the inequality in the “Global South'', which caught our attention. We found that many southern countries like countries in Africa have very limited health workforce and resources that are way below the very basic standard set by WHO. To address the concern, we need to solve the question: what would be the main factor causing the huge inequity? According to research, we found one of the most important and unexpected factors that led to and worsen the situation is neocolonialism in the forms of debt. In our project, we will provide data supporting our theory about how international debts have influenced health systems in the “Global South” countries.

## Problem Domain

**Health Indicators  - how to define health inequality?**
Using some important indicator including morality rates, vaccination rates, and HIV incidence could help us to compare and realize the how much some of the countries are left behind and the significance of promoting health equity. All the indicators are essential medical needs that citizens today require for well-being and are influential to judge one country's medical level. The stakeholders are essentially everyone in the world, because one nation’s medical care policies are, as mentioned, influential to every single individual. One could be benefit from a well-established health system, and one could be also suffered from poor-designed and financial incapable health system.

    Here is an article from New York Times, “Racial Inequities Persist in Health Care Despite Expanded Insurance”, which focuses on another significant factor that causes health inequality, race. The author used many indicators to show the existence of the problem and addressed the importance of solving the inequality. 
**Debts - how much debts are these “Global South” countries facing?**
As discussed, we made the prediction that the debts were a primary reason for the inequality of the health system, so we want to take time to look at the reason and amount of money behind the debts, which influence governments’ spending decisions and citizen’s welfare.

    Here is an article from the Guardian, called “Aid in reverse: how poor countries develop rich countries”, written by Jason Hickel. Jason in this article illustrated how developing countries in the “Global South” send trillions of dollars more through debts to the west than the other way around, which gave us an idea what neocolonialism is and the huge impact made by debt. 
**Austerity - How were paying back debts influence the health system?**
Then, we have to prove our assumption by linking the debt-paying to the insufficient healthcare system. Debts include loans from multilateral lending agencies and bilateral loans take up a big component of government expenditure and lead to no-choice austerity that makes the government cut expenses in education, healthcare, and so on. Governments spend more money on debt payments than on public health, and COVID intensifies the debt situation, giving the government even more debts, more pressure to repay the debts, and exposed shortages in the national healthcare system are exposed: even though the governments built primary healthcare system to provide basic care to their citizens, the high demand for healthcare but the countries only have a limited number of workers with low payment.

    Here is a “stop austerity” act promotion article, “END AUSTERITY, A Global Report on Budget Cuts and Harmful Social Reforms in 2022-25” which illustrates the influence of international debt, especially in the circumstance of Covid 19. The authors,ISABEL ORTIZ and MATTHEW CUMMINS, promoted for a debt relif to help the countries devote more money to health, instead of debts. 

### Background and framing
The Global South referred to regions within Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, and specifically means the developing countries in these region that suffer poverty and limited resources. A majorty of these countries suffered international debts from the global bank and advanced countries, and the debt repayment made up a larger portion of their government expenditures. 

### Direct and indirect stakeholders
The direct stakeholders would be citizens in all these countries who suffers from limited medical resources, and the indirect stakeholders can be everyone in the world. Under the pandemic situation, the public health is essentially important and the well-being in one place would positively relate to the other, and vice versa. 

### Human values
Human value that we want to propose in our project would be integrity and equality. 

### Possible harms and benefits
There are many organizations taking actions in improving this situation, including advocating debt relif and donating essential health equipment, which is a good start shows more and more of us are realizing this problem. We making this project primarily want that we can let people be aware about it and using the data visualization to demonstrate how bad it is.

## Research Questions
1. To define the inequality: compared to other countries that have no or little debt, how much money, or what percentage of the government compensation are spent on healthcare that are suffering from international debts?
2. For the “Global South” country, compared to money spent on debts, how much money, or what percentage of the government compensation are spent on healthcare?
3. For the “Global South” country, how insufficient are they in the perspective of the health system?
4. What is the standard level of health resource for a country to equip?

## The Dataset
- Health Indicators (Health Inequality Monitor Data Repository) https://www.who.int/data/inequality-monitor/data
 Here is the health indicator data set, where includes **13 categories of indicators**, including COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) indicators, Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) indicators, Childhood immunization indicators, Subnational DTP immunization dropout rates using administrative data, HIV indicators, Tuberculosis indicators, Malaria indicators, Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) indicators, Indonesia health indicators, Brazil health indicators by municipality, and WHO Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW 13) indicators. All the indicators combined together can give us a quite comprehensive picture of each country’s medicare capability and potential problems they were facing from the perspective of health. We can compare each countries’ situation in the case of each indicator to summarize the inequality, which is the center of our project. 
    _* Sorry we cannot have a table that presents the name of each data file, the number of observations (rows), and the number of variables (columns) because there are too many tables in the dataset to conclude, and we did not decide to use which indicators for our research right now. I have encludied all the indicators above._

This data set is collected by the WHO (world health organization) in June 2022. The purpose is not specifically mentioned in the webstite, but they had this big category in their home page about health inequality. In WHO Thirteenth General Programme of Work, they indicated the mission of “identifying health inequalities and their drivers is essential for achieving health equity”, which I assume is the purpose of the data set. This is also where I found the data. In addition, the value of WHO is that “leads and champions global efforts to achieve better health for all. By connecting countries, people and partners, we strive to give everyone, everywhere an equal chance at a safe and healthy life.” WHO gets its funding from two main sources: Member States paying their assessed contributions (countries’ membership dues), and voluntary contributions from Member States and other partners, so we do not think WHO, as a non-profit organization, is making money from the data. Based on the widespread WHO, we believe the data is credible.

## Expected Implications
1. Highlighting the inequality in the healthcare system across different countries can bring to light the major financial factors that cause countries to receive more or less healthcare than others. This information can be organized in an interactive graph that describes the value of relevant aspects of the economy. Policymakers can use this database as a resource in order to pinpoint these issues and propose solutions through a legal perspective by implementing new laws or different legislation.
2. Our biggest goal for this project is to gain knowledge on the various aspects of each country’s healthcare system and how that reflects on the quality of care people receive compared to each country. This information can be useful for creating a change in society with the way healthcare is given to people in various countries. Organizations that are associated with this topic can use this data to create infographics that raise awareness on the inequality countries face in their healthcare system. These infographics can be posted through social media or websites which can further be spread across the country and internationally.
