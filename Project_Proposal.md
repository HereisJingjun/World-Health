## Abstract
Our question is what caused the huge inequality of healthcare between different countries. We think this question is important because health be a basic and essential need for all the human beings, but the health serveces provided by many countries in the word is insufficient. We think if we need to solve the problem, we need to first understand the reason led to this situation. In this case, we find an essential factor and use data to illustrate how the factor are influential to cause the inequality.

## Introduction
“Health for all now!” is the slogan of the People’s Health Movement. However, we are still far from accomplishing it. Along with the outbreak of the pandemic, more and more studies began to focus on longstanding gaps in medical care, especially the inequality in the “Global South”, which caught our attention. We found that many southern countries like countries in Africa have very limited health work force and resources that is way below the very basic standard set by WHO. To address the concern, we need to solve the question: what would be the main factor causing the huge inequity? According to research, we found one of the most important and unexpected factors that led to and worsen the situation is neocolonialism in the forms of debt. In our project, we will provide data supporting our theory showing how did international debts have influenced health systems in the “Global South” countries.
