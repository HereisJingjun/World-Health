# Exploratory Analysis: Understanding Global Healthcare Inequalities by Country Debt

# Overview
This is a brief report regarding the influence of international debts over government' health spending and how is that negatively influence local citizens' health. This page compares the health spending and health situation between countries all over the world and shows the correlation between debt and health spending per capital.

# Summary Table
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library("dplyr")
library("tidyverse")
source("../source/summary_table.R")
print(debt_and_health_spending)
```
`table`

# Chart 1: Maps

## Government Heath Expenditure per capital and Health Spending as a Share of Total Government Expenditure
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
options(repos=structure(c(CRAN="YOUR FAVORITE MIRROR")))
install.packages("dplyr", dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies = TRUE)
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
install.packages("maps",dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages("viridis", dependencies = TRUE)
require("viridis")
library("maps")
require(maps)
source("../per capital.R")
```
To compare the each countries' govenment health spending per capital, this is a global map showing the health spending in 2019.


# Chart 2: Scatter Plot

## Government Debt and Health Spending
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library("dplyr")
library("tidyverse")
library("ggplot2")
library("plotly")
require(plotly)
source("../source/chart_2.R")
print(chart_2)
```
This chart is a scatter plot showing the relationship between a country's government debt and government health spending. Each point represents a country. On the x-axis is the net credit or debt of that country from 2020 and on the y-axis is the health spending as a percent of total government expenditure.







## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test("Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
