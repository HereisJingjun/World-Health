# Chart 2: Scatter Plot: Government Debt and Health Spending
```{r}
library("dplyr")
library("tidyverse")
library("ggplot2")
library("plotly")
require(plotly)
source("../chart_2.R")
chart_2_test()
```
This chart is a scatter plot showing the relationship between a country's government debt and government health spending. Each point represents a country. On the x-axis is the net credit or debt of that country from 2020 and on the y-axis is the health spending as a percent of total government expenditure.







## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
options(repos=structure(c(CRAN="YOUR FAVORITE MIRROR")))
install.packages("dplyr", dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies = TRUE)
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
install.packages("maps",dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages("viridis", dependencies = TRUE)
require("viridis")
library("maps")
require(maps)
source("../per capital.R")
```


### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
msg <- data_access_test("Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
