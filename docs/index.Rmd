# Exploratory Analysis: Understanding Global Healthcare Inequalities by Country Debt

## Overview
This is a brief report regarding the influence of international debts over government' health spending and how is that negatively influence local citizens' health. This page compares the health spending and health situation between countries all over the world and shows the correlation between debt and health spending per capital.

## Summary Table
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library("dplyr")
library("tidyverse")
source("../source/summary_table.R")
print(joined_data)
```

## Chart 1: Maps

#### Government Heath Expenditure per capital and Health Spending as a Share of Total Government Expenditure
##To compare the each countries' government health spending per capital, this is a global map showing the health spending in 2019. After that, we have a map showing the government health spending as share of the overall government expenditure
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
options(repos=structure(c(CRAN="YOUR FAVORITE MIRROR")))
install.packages("dplyr", dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies = TRUE)
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
install.packages("maps",dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages("viridis", dependencies = TRUE)
require("viridis")
library("maps")
require(maps)
source("../source/per capital.R")
```



## Chart 2: Scatter Plot

#### Government Debt and Health Spending
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
install.packages("plotly", dependencies = TRUE)
library("dplyr")
library("tidyverse")
library("ggplot2")
library("plotly")
require(plotly)
source("../source/chart_2.R")
ggplotly(plot)
```
This chart is a scatter plot showing the relationship between a country's government debt and government health spending. Each point represents a country. On the x-axis is the a numeric indicator for net creditor(+) or debtor(-) of that country from 2020. On the y-axis is the health spending as a percent of total government expenditure. This number is taken form the most-recent year of data collection, which most are from 2019 with a few from 2018. The color of each point tells you what the level of debt risk calculated by the Jubilee Debt Campaign. Hover over a point for more specific statistical information. The line shows a positive trend, with a dip where countries are neither a very far into debt or are large creditors.

## Chart 3: Barplot
#### Financial Status and Health Indicators
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
install.packages("hrbrthemes", dependencies = TRUE)
library("hrbrthemes")
library("dplyr")
library("tidyverse")
library("ggplot2")
source("../source/MMR.R")

```
This barplot depicts the maternal mortality rate of women across different countries around the world with different financial statuses. Based on this data, countries with lower incomes and less access to healthcare have a larger negative effect on womenâ€™s health which proses as a bigger risk.





## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test("Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
